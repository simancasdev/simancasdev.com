          Software Developer. I have been working mainly in front-end
          development for web and mobile applications. I like to always study
          and expand my knowledge to improve my practices always looking for
          code that have good practices like SOLID and DRY principles. Also, I
          always try to keep in mind data structures and algorithms that can
          allow the best performance in each feature.
