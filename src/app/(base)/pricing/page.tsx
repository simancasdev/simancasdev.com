          âœ… Okay, let me clarify something first. In all my years working as a
          software developer I have learned that usually clients have some
          priorities for their projects; so with that in mind, you can decide on
          what you want to focus my development hours. I usually work 8hr per
          day, so we (you and I) can make those hours really worth it
        </Typography>
      </Row>
      <Column>
        <Typography variant="title">What is my hour rate?</Typography>
        <Row alignItems="flex-end">
          <Typography fontSize={30}>$15</Typography>
          <Typography>/hr</Typography>
        </Row>
      </Column>
    </Column>
  );
}
